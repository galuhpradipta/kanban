# Kanban Project
This project is a simple kanban board, built using react for the frontend, tailwind for styling, and vite for a fast development experience.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have node and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone this repository and install the project dependencies by running the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/username/kanban-project.git
$ cd kanban-project
$ npm install
```

### Running the Project
To run the project in development mode, you can use the npm start command, which will start the development server and open the project in your default browser.

```

```
You can then make changes to the code and the project will automatically reload in the browser to reflect your changes.

To create a production build of the project, you can use the npm run build command. This will create a minified version of the code in the dist directory, which you can then deploy to a hosting provider of your choice.

```
npm run build
```
Deployment
To deploy the production build of this project, you'll need to transfer the files in the dist directory to your chosen hosting provider. The specific steps for doing this will vary depending on the provider you choose, so consult their documentation for more information.
